## 🚀 Pre-compiled App (Release APK)

A production-ready release-grade APK is pre-packaged and placed in the root of the workspace directory:
👉 **`fitness.apk`**

### Installation Guide:
1. Copy `fitness.apk` to your Android device.
2. Open the file on your device and install (ensure "Install from unknown sources" is enabled in your Android settings).
3. The app is completely self-contained—no local Metro server or computer connection is required to run it!

---

## 💻 Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v20+)
- Android Studio & Android SDK
- JDK 17+

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository and navigate to the project:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd FitnessApp/FitnessApp
   ```
2. **Install all dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the Metro Bundler:**
   ```bash
   npx react-native start --reset-cache
   ```
4. **Compile and run on your Android Emulator:**
   In a separate terminal, launch:
   ```bash
   npm run android
   ```

## 🧠 Technical Challenges Solved

- **Android AAPT2 Resource Processing**: Resolved image compilation failures during release packaging by programmatically sanitizing color profiles and stripping metadata chunks using standard encoders.
- **Vector Icons Compilation Assets**: Integrated custom Gradle font-copy scripts into `android/app/build.gradle` to automate standard `.ttf` inclusion inside the APK.
- **Responsive Layout Architecture**: Tackled layout overflow and flex restrictions inside lists using dynamic `flexGrow` properties to ensure clean scrollability.
